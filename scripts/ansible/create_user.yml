# Script to create a system user on servers
#
# To run the script:
# ansible-playbook -K create_user.yml -i hosts-xxx -e 'target=targethost name=user key="key"'
# notice the double quotes around the key so spaces are interpreted as part of it
# ansible-playbook -K create_user.yml -i hosts-xxx -e 'target=targethost ip=www.xxx.yyy.zzz name=user key="key"'
# you can specify an IP for that user with the syntax above
# ansible-playbook -K create_user.yml -i hosts-xxx -e 'target=targethost name=user key="key"' --limit=*.mydomain.com
